Personal-Project
================

For my personal project I made a website that displays phone homescreens. It’s called “Appknowme.com” and it has screenshots different people’s initial screens on their phones.

I made it because one day I was looking at the phones on my apps and started becoming curious as to what other people had. Sure I had some apps I thought were cool and I had them set up in a way specific to how I like them; but, I began to wonder what other people’s phones were like. I highly doubted that they were the same and I wanted to see just how different they could be. I made the website, published it (it’s currently live),  and posted it on Facebook. While not everyone shared the same enthusiasm I still got a few people to submit their screenshots. 

I am going to keep it up because I know one day it will interest other people the way it interests me. I just need to market it right; but I do not have the energy or time to want to do that at this moment. I am working on publishing other ideas I have.

I have a page for iPhone homescreens and one for Android screens; the homepage is a combination of the two. There’s also a submit page for instructions on how to get your own screen up on there.
